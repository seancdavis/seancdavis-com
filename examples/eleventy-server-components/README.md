# Eleventy Server Components

This is a simple example showing how to use built-in templating to setup components in your Eleventy website.

This is not a scalable solution, but one built specifically to serve the code snippets in an article.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies (I use Yarn, but here are the commands with NPM):

    $ npm install

Start the dev server:

    $ npm run dev

Then the site will be running at localhost:8080.

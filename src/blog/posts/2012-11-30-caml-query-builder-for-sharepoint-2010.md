[This handy CAML Query Builder from U2U](http://www.u2u.be/res/tools/camlquerybuilder.aspx)Â can be very useful in SharePoint development. I'll use it from time-to-time in future SharePoint and SPServices posts, but wanted to bring it to your attention

You'll notice the builder is built for SP 2003 and 2007 without mention of 2010. [Here's a nice post](http://ranaictiu-technicalblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/u2u-caml-query-builder-for-sharepoint.html) explaining the bugs about using it with SP 2010. In general, though, I've had no issues using this application with SP 2010. My use is primarily to aid client-side development through the use of the SPService JavaScript library. The most important note in my use is to ensure you connect via SharePoint Web Services (see below).

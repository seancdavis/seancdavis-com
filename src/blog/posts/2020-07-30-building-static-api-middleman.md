This article is part of a series of tutorials on building a _static API_. You can view the full list of available static API tutorials in [the introductory article](/blog/how-to-build-static-api/), which also provides some background on the examples we're using here.

If you'd like additional information on what a static API is, check out [_WTF is a Static API?_](/blog/lets-talk-about-static-apis/)

This tutorial will walk through building a static API using [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/). Middleman is a [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/) written in Ruby. It pulls a handful of conventions from [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), which is what first attracted me to it.

Oh, and hey! This tutorial also marks one of the first with an accompanying video! If that's more of your style of learning, watch the video below instead:

The written tutorial follows. But if you're just looking for the code reference, [you can find that here](https://github.com/seancdavis/middleman-static-api).

## Step 1: Getting Started

I'm going to assume that if you're here to learn about building a static API with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), you already have some experience with the framework. If not, I encourage you to check out its documentation on [installing](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/install/) and [starting a new project](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/start-new-site/).

I called my project `middleman-static-api`, and I used the default starter template, which means my `init` command looked like this:

    $ middleman init middleman-static-api

That command cloned the default starter template and installed the bundle (ruby gems). So now we're ready to go, all we have to do is change into that directory:

    $ cd middleman-static-api

## Step 2: Add Data Files

We're going to use the data examples from [the intro article](/blog/how-to-build-static-api/). Middleman's convention is to put [data files in a `data` directory](https://middlemanapp.com/advanced/data-files/). While it's not the only option, using the `data` directory means they will get picked up automatically and be available in your front-end templates.

Grouping the files within a subdirectory in the `data` directory means they will be available through a variable matching that name. For example, if we put all our data files in `data/earworms/...` they would all be available via `data.earworms` in the `config.rb` file and in our templates (more on this later).

Another Middleman convention is to use YAML files, although JSON files will also work.

So, we're going to create one file for each earworm (again, if you care to, check out the intro on background to our scenario). We _could_ put all these earworms in a single file at `data/earworms.yml`, but eventually it'll become difficult to manage. I find it easier to use separate files for individual pieces of content.

Here are our three files:

`data/earworms/2020-03-29.yml` {.filename}

```yaml
---
id: 1
date: 2020-03-29
title: Perfect Illusion
artist: Lady Gaga
spotify_url: https://open.spotify.com/track/56ZrTFkANjeAMiS14njg4E?si=oaaJCMbiTw2NqYK-L7CSEQ
```

`data/earworms/2020-03-30.yml` {.filename}

```yaml
---
id: 2
date: 2020-03-30
title: Into the Unknown

spotify_url: https://open.spotify.com/track/3Z0oQ8r78OUaHvGPiDBR3W?si=__mISyOgTCy0nzyoumBiUg
```

`data/earworms/2020-03-31.yml` {.filename}

```yaml
---
id: 3
date: 2020-03-31
title: Wait for It
artist: Leslie Odom Jr.
spotify_url: https://open.spotify.com/track/7EqpEBPOohgk7NnKvBGFWo?si=eceqQWGATkO1HJ7n-gKOEQ
```

## Step 3: Create Index File

We now have our data, but we haven't surfaced it anywhere on the front-end. We're going to do so through our index file, or the file that will list all the data we've created (i.e. all the earworms).

While we could simply make this the home page of the site, remember that we're building an API. It's a good practice to make URLs declarative and semantic. Therefore, instead of having the actual index path spit out all the data, I'd prefer to nest earworms under `/earworms`. That way we are setting ourselves up to expand to other types of data in the future without having to rewrite code for the sources already consuming the API.

Middleman pulls much inspiration from [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), and one of those is the way in which it handles templating. Middleman [prefers ERB templates](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/templating-language/), but supports a few others out of the box, with [options to expand from there](https://middlemanapp.com/advanced/template-engine-options/).

The file-naming is a little weird when working with Middleman templates because you will often see multiple extensions on a file. They are processed from right-to-left. That means that if I have a file named `hello.json.erb`, Middleman is going to first process the file as a `.erb` file, and then as a `.json` file.

That's the approach we're going to take here, too, as we want our file to ultimately be a `.json` file. And while we _could_ use a tool like [jbuilder](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder), I'm going to show you how simple it is to write these JSON files by hand using Ruby libraries.

But first, let's start by creating our file at `source/earworms.json.erb` and making sure we're setup correctly. Because this is JSON, we'll just include an empty object to start:

`source/earworms.json.erb` {.filename}

```erb
{}
```

### Preview Time!

Now is the time to make sure you have everything installed as expected and can get to this page. Start your server:

    $ bundle exec middleman

And then visit [localhost:4567/earworms.json](http://localhost:4567/earworms.json) to see the result. You should see an empty object.

    src="/blog/200730/earworms-empty-object.png",
    alt="Earworms - Empty Object" %}

### Add Meta Data

Following the direction of the intro article, let's next add meta to our object. We learned in the intro that it's a good practice to put our results in a `results` object so that we have more flexibility to change the structure of the response down the road.

For now, all we want to do is return the count, or the number of earworms that we have in the collection. To do that, we can use [Ruby's JSON module](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.1/libdoc/json/rdoc/JSON.html). The [`generate` method](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.1/libdoc/json/rdoc/JSON.html#method-i-generate) will help us convert a ruby hash or array into valid JSON, and we _could_ even make it pretty (we're not going to worry about that, though).

`source/earworms.json.erb` {.filename}

```erb
<%= JSON.generate({ meta: { count: data.earworms.size } }) %>
```

Now, refreshing the page, you should see the count of `3` nested within a `meta` object.

{% post_image
    src="/blog/200730/earworms-meta-count.png",
    alt="Earworms - Meta Count" %}

_Note: I like using a Chrome extension to format JSON for me. It's called [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en). It cleans up the output to look like this:_

{% post_image
    src="/blog/200730/earworms-meta-count-formatted.png",
    alt="Earworms - Meta Count, Formatted Code" %}

### Add the Earworms Data

Now that we've gotten our feet wet, let's add the earworms data within a `results` array. Here's the code:

```erb
<%= JSON.generate(
  results: data.earworms.values,
  meta: {
    count: data.earworms.size
  }
) %>
```

Refresh the browser and you should see all the data.

{% post_image
    src="/blog/200730/earworms-with-data.png",
    alt="Earworms Data" %}

Let's go back to how we got all that data from `data.earworms.values`.

First, we know that `data` is a collection of everything within the `data` directory. And our data is available via `data.earworms` because we've nested our data files under an `earworms` directory.

But if we were to look at what class `data.earworms` is, we'd get `Middleman::Util::EnhancedHash`. It's a custom utility coming from Middleman. It's kind of like an array and kind of like a hash, where the first element (or the _key_) is the name of the file without the extension, and the second is the parsed content of the file.

And we have methods we can run on hashes, like `keys` and `values`. So if we tried `data.earworms.keys` we'd get:

```ruby
["2020-03-30", "2020-03-31", "2020-03-29"]
```

## Step 4: Add Individual Files

As our last step here, let's create individual files so that if we want to get data just for a single earworm, we can do so by going to `/earworms/[id].json` where `[id]` is the `id` attribute coming from the data files we've created.

In this case we don't want to have to manually create a template for each data file â€” that defeats the purpose of having data files. Instead we can use the `config.rb` file to [create dynamic pages using the proxy method](https://middlemanapp.com/advanced/dynamic-pages/). That code looks like this:

`config.rb` {.filename}

```ruby
# ...

data.earworms.each do |date, worm|
  proxy(
    "/earworms/#{worm.id}.json",
    "/earworms/template.json",
    locals: { worm: worm },
    ignore: true
  )
end
```

Let's talk about what's going on in a few places here.

If you're used to Ruby code, `data.earworms.each do |date, worm|` may look a little weird because it's passing two objects to the block. As I mentioned above, this is because the first value is the name of the file without the extension. (I called it `date` because in our case it represents a date.) And the second object (`worm`) is the parsed data from the file.

With `proxy`, the first argument is the path to where the page should live and the second is the template. So we're saying use a template at `source/earworms/template.json` and proxy that to a page at `/earworms/[id].json`. (Notice that you don't need the `.erb` at the end of the template filename.

`locals` is an object which passes data into the template. In this case, we're passing `worm` into the template, which means we can use the variable `worm` in our ERB code, as you'll see below.

And finally, `ignore: true` tells Middleman to not process the template file as a page on the front-end of the site.

The template itself is super simple.

`source/earworms/template.json.erb` {.filename}

```erb
<%= JSON.generate(worm) %>
```

Restart your server and then try it out in the browser at [localhost:4567/earworms/1.json](http://localhost:4567/earworms/1.json) and you should see the data for _Perfect Illusion_, which was the data file with the `id` value of `1`.

{% post_image
    src="/blog/200730/earworm-detail.png",
    alt="Earworms - Detail View" %}

You can try the same thing with `2.json` and `3.json`, but notice that any others should throw a 404 error.

## Cleaning Up

And that's it! Now you have an API. There's a route that lists all your earworms and individual routes for each earworm. Now you can deploy that and use it wherever you'd like!

That said, some tasks you may want to consider before taking something like this into production:

- Ensure you have proper header rules so that you're protecting against CORS and also delivering these files with the appropriate MIME type. If using a service like [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), most of this will be done for you.
- Remove the default home page because this site is meant to be an API. You may even consider redirecting the home page to the `/earworms.json` path temporarily.
- You can also consider redirecting all requests that don't end in `.json` to append the `.json` to them. Another option is to remove `.json` from your file extensions, while making sure the MIME type remains correct.
- And you may even want to control the order of the earworms on the index page.

I've recently been introduced to Git, the new most amazing thing in my development life. Git is a version control application for managing source code. Git can be used either on the command line or on a [Git GUI client](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

I highly recommend you use git to manage your code.

## GitHub

If you've heard of Git, or even if you've just searched for it, you probably came across [GitHub](https://github.com/). It's exactly what it sounds like -- a place to store and share git repositories.

GitHub is a great community for open source projects, but it can get pricey if you don't want to share your code with the public community.

## Free Alternatives

If your code needs to be private, there are plenty of free alternatives to GitHub. I mentioned a couple in [this article](/blog/free-alternatives-to-github-for-private-git-hosting/).

## Backup Your Code and Work Cross-Platform

The idea here is that you create a local repository and then push to a remote repository, hosted by the service you choose. This ensures you can pull the code down to a different machine if necessary, and it also makes it easy for others to view your code and help you.

## If You Don't Know Git

Don't worry! It's ridiculously easy to learn. But I'm not going to teach you here because it's so well-documented on its site. [Check it out here](http://git-scm.com/documentation).

_The Spinneret_ is to be my monthly collection of all things web development. An issue will typically include:

- Content I've read or written
- Tools I've discovered that seem interesting or valuable
- The most intriguing conversations from my team at [Ample](https://www.helloample.com/)

My goal in this venture is to publish each month's issue near the beginning or middle of the following month. Therefore, most of the content within each issue should be less than six weeks old, at least to me.

## The Name

A spinneret is the organ within spiders that produces the silk used in the creation of their webs. I liked the idea of using _Spinneret_ as a name, as these issues are meant to be a collection of little tidbits that we're using to build the web every day.

## Issues

The first issue will be released tomorrow, covering May 2020. The easiest way to see an updated list of issues is to look on [the tag page for _The Spinneret_](/blog/tag/spinneret/).

## Submitting Content

If you have something interesting to share that you think belongs in this collection, feel free to [start a conversation with me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/seancdavis29).

## Subscribing to New Issues

I also plan to send issues out via email. You can join that list to receive exactly one email every month in your inbox by filling out the form in the footer below.

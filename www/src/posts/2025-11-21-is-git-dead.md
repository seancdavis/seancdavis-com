Is Git dead?

That's a dramatic title, so let's get the first thing out of the way: the answer is no.

## Git is very much alive

Being at GitHub Universe last month really solidified that for me. There are all types of developers out there — not just 17 million front-end JavaScript developers, but millions and millions more who use Git for code version control.

As a result, Git has become the core of the majority of developer workloads. That foundation really comes from Git because it's been, for the last 15 or so years, the primary mechanism through which we've moved code around the internet. It's that fundamental trigger of "something has changed, and now we need to do something as a result of it."

We can see how rich that space is and how much potential there is by looking at all of the stuff that GitHub is working on. I always say: if Git is the foundation of this and GitHub is really the platform where most developer workflows are rooted, then no — it's not going away. Not anytime soon, at least. And I think we're going to see some really cool and useful flows that have Git at their foundation.

## But let's be honest: Git is goofy

Let's admit it — Git is a little goofy. Especially for those new to development, it's just got a lot of concepts that are hard to grasp when you're already just trying to understand how code works.

Now couple that with another reality: there are millions and millions of people today building websites through AI agents who have no understanding of what the code actually does and how it works.

Within that group, there's a spectrum of interest in understanding the underlying technology. Some people are actually trying to build things for real — for business or to improve in some way professionally. Even if they don't necessarily want to be developers, they may want to understand what's actually happening.

On the other end of the spectrum, there are people who just find it really cool to spin things up, or they want to build their own website. They're not doing it for financial, professional, or career gain — even indirectly. It might just be for fun.

## A new opportunity for Git education

I think there's a subset of new developers today who would be open to learning Git. And I think there is an opportunity to rethink how we introduce this new cohort to Git in a way that can enable them to be successful — because they might not necessarily actually touch it directly, but often through an agent.

What becomes more important than knowing the commands is knowing about the paradigm and the way it works. We don't have to memorize the commands, but we can understand the language to use to instruct our agents on what to do using Git workflows. I see a really good future in that sense.

## The growing non-Git cohort

But there's a big portion of the spectrum that doesn't actually even care and won't necessarily find it useful. I think it could help them, but there's a growing contingent of folks that, even if they could benefit from Git, might not need it.

And I think that's really interesting because, for 10 years, the vast majority of Netlify users used Git as that foundation. Git workflows were really what drove activity and usage of Netlify. And there have always been non-Git workflows for Netlify — they just haven't been super prevalent.

Well, we're actually seeing a shift there. We're seeing this desire for more and more people not wanting or needing Git. And I think that's really interesting.

## What are our options?

We have options here.

### Abstraction layers

Is there a layer of abstraction where Git is still the foundation, and then we introduce tooling to make the way we interact with version control simpler for people who don't want or need to understand how code works? People who don't have any interest in having a GitHub account and might not need a GitHub account?

To me, that's a really interesting concept: people might actually just skip GitHub. You can have this full flow of how you build your website, and you might not actually need GitHub to be part of it — while also not being the developer who understands how the code works.

This has always been possible. It's just that it hasn't really made sense for developers to do it because Git is so powerful. But now there are other tools.

### Alternatives to Git

Maybe there's actually not a need for Git in every scenario. Maybe we have other ways that we can simplify version control without this tool.

## The bottom line

So is Git dead? No, not by a long shot.

Will it ever die? I don't know.

Will it be necessary for building for the web in the future? Probably not.

And I would argue that there's a real opportunity for us to think about tooling and education around people who don't and wouldn't value Git — because they don't need it.

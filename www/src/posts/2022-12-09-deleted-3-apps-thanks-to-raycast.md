Okay, so one of them was [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). But, seriously, [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) is amazing!

## What Sets Raycast Apart

At first, Raycast seemed like _yet another productivity tool_. I read about it more than a year before I adopted it. I was happy with Alfred. And it seemed like another Alfred.

As most things go for me, it took a word-of-mouth recommendation from a colleague who really hyped Raycast. So I said I would try it for one week and then decide which app to delete.

After just two days, I deleted Alfred, because:

- At the most basic level, they can accomplish the same thing.
- Raycast has featured packed into its free tier that would require payment for Alfred.
- The (unofficial) [Raycast Marketplace](https://scriptcommands.com/) is extensive and has a number of scripts. I haven't even brushed the surface of this yet, but I have started using it to create issues on GitHub for this website without opening the browser, which is amazing!
- Writing your own script is honestly [not that intimidating](https://www.raycast.com/blog/getting-started-with-script-commands). I haven't built anything I've used, but I've tinkered with it, and the experience is great. Usually these things get super complicated, but this is just JavaScript.

## Apps I Deleted

Aside from Alfred, I've also deleted:

- Clipboard manager ([CopyClip 2](https://fiplab.com/apps/copyclip-for-mac)), which I had paid for. Raycast has this built in and it works great.
- Window manager ([Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/)). Raycast's window manager has all the same capabilities, and I could simplify it to focus on my typical arrangements. I've also recently wanted to introduce a gap between windows, which Raycast could handle.

I'm sure there's much for me to discover, and I hope there are more apps I can delete in the future. But for now, I'm happy.

Raycast is amazing!

If you're unsure, make it an experiment. Try it for a week. Ditch it if it doesn't blow your mind.

I spent the better part of two full days last week absolutely hammering on Claude. I mean, pushing it further than I ever have before.

And my brain did something interesting in that time.

It felt like I transported myself back a decade. Back to 2014, 2015—my early Rails days.

It was the first time in a long, long time that I felt truly obsessed with what I was doing.

## The "Head-in-the-Sand" Flow

You know the feeling. Head in the sand. Absolutely cranking. Hitting walls and getting pissed off because you want the thing to work, and you want it to work *right now*.

It’s that feeling where you need to tear yourself away from the screen. You find yourself shirking other life responsibilities just to build. I found myself waking up on Saturday knowing I really needed to look at the family budget, but instead, I spent three hours building.

There are positives and negatives to that, of course. That obsession can’t take over my life—I have a lot more responsibilities now than I did ten years ago. But the energy? The passion? It was electric.

It’s been there in spurts recently. Things started to click for me around August or September of last year. But not to this level.

## AI as a Time Machine

We talk a lot about AI making us faster. About efficiency. About 10x engineers.

But I think we’re missing a key angle: **The "Obsession" Metric.**

Modern AI coding tools didn't just make me faster. They removed the friction that usually snaps me out of that flow state.

Ten years ago, I was most productive when I was in a hole, shutting the world out for three or four hours at a time. The manual coding process demanded it. You needed those big chunks of time to minimize context switching.

I had a theory going into last week that the people who can work in the opposite way—bouncing between tasks—would be the ones who produce the most today. But when I put that to the test, bouncing between three or four applications, I hit a wall. It was too many threads.

## The Return of the Builder

What I realized is that while tools like Claude can do the thinking about implementation and some planning, they cannot read your thoughts. Human thought is erratic.

There is no replacement for sitting down, taking a moment, and really thinking about the thing you are trying to build. You have to outline the problem and work with the tool to craft a solution.

But once you're in that groove? It feels like the old days. You're just *building*.

I found that I want to do my MVP builds locally today. There is a ton of value in that quick back-and-forth. It helps me think through the process. I feel like I'm moving incredibly fast, but grounded in the code.

Then, once the basic functionality is there, once the visual design looks decent, *that* is when I switch to working asynchronously.

## Reigniting the Flame

This experience wasn't just about getting code written. It was about remembering why I love building software.

It’s about that obsession. That drive to see something exist that didn't exist an hour ago.

AI isn't just automating away the work. For me, it's clearing the path so I can get back to the part of coding I fell in love with a decade ago. It’s making me obsessive again. And honestly? It feels good to be back.

I've been doing a lot of building lately. Like, a _lot_. Head-in-the-sand, multiple-projects-at-once, hitting-my-Claude-limits kind of building. And in the process, I've started to notice a pattern emerging in how I work most effectively with AI coding tools.

It's a two-phase approach: **synchronous for the MVP, asynchronous for everything after**.

## The MVP requires your attention

When I'm standing up a new project from scratch, I can't just fire off a prompt and walk away. There's too much thinking, too much planning, too much handholding involved.

AI tools like Claude are incredible. They can do the thinking about implementation. They can plan. They can write solid code. But they can't read your thoughts. And human thought is erratic — you're iterating on the vision in your head while you're building.

So for those early stages, I want quick back-and-forth. I want to be in the loop, peppering messages, trying things, course-correcting. Whether that's doing the actual coding or just building out a detailed plan — either way, it takes a lot more of your attention.

I don't think it really matters if you prefer to plan deeply before handing off or build incrementally toward your MVP. Those are two different paths to the same point. But that point — where you have a working MVP that does the basic thing you set out to do — that's the inflection point.

## Then you switch to async

Once I get to a place where the core functionality is there, the basic visual design works, and it's using the tools I want — that's when I switch modes.

That's when I want to work asynchronously.

The synchronous work is really about being thoughtful in the planning and initial build. Once that's stable, a lot of the remaining work — polish, expansion, additional features — can be offloaded. You can let agents run with one idea at a time while you move on to the next thing that requires your deeper attention.

## Why this matters

The drive is really to get to that point where you can work asynchronously. Because _then_ you can be more effective. Then you can move on to the next thing that requires focus. Then you can let agents run with multiple complementary ideas in parallel.

This is product management work, in a sense. You're determining what needs your attention now versus what can be handed off. And AI has changed the calculus — the handoff is faster and cheaper than it's ever been.

So yes, you really do have to focus to get an MVP stood up. Or at least to get the _plan_ for an MVP stood up. But the goal is to get past that point as quickly as you can — without sacrificing the quality of your thinking — so you can scale yourself through asynchronous work.

I'm still experimenting with this. But so far, it's been a useful mental model for how I approach new projects. Get to the MVP synchronously. Then let the agents take it from there.

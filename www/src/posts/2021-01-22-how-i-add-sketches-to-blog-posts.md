Adding visual references to blog posts is a great way to help a reader understand an abstract or theoretical concept. You know the old saying — _A picture is worth a thousand words_. A graphic can help clear up an abstract concept without having to force another handful of paragraphs down readers' throats.

But when it comes to making the graphics, I've always struggled. I like good design, I appreciate good design, I'm a bit of a perfectionist, and I'm also not very good at designing things.

In my early blogging days, I made used an art program like [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator) or [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/). [This article](/posts/how-the-web-works/) has an early version of my approach (branded for the blog on which it was first published). But getting those right was time-consuming. I wanted the graphics to remain refined, but I didn't work in those art programs for hours trying to get it right. I knew I wasn't going to be efficient with my approach, given the low frequency at which I had to create art files.

Within the last year, my writing has transitioned more conceptual and theoretical — a healthy balance of _how-tos_ and _what-ifs_. That has pushed me to figure out how to get back into adding visuals to posts. I didn't want to go down that same road of tedium and frustration.

After working through the kinks, I have a practice I'm relatively with today. It's looks a little clunky on paper, but it gives me the speed and flexibility I require to be effective.

## The Equipment

The hardware and software I use includes:

- An [iPad](https://www.apple.com/ipad/) (I got the least expensive one and it works great)
- An [Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/) (the old generation)
- [Notability](https://www.gingerlabs.com/) for both the iPad and the Mac

## The Process

This is my process today:

**Step 1:** Create sketch in Notability on iPad using the Apple Pencil.

{% post_image
    tag="span",
    alt="Blog Posts Sketch - Step 1",
    src="/posts/210122/post-sketch-step-01.png" %}

**Step 2:** Open the note in Notability on the Mac laptop.

{% post_image tag="span",
    alt="Blog Posts Sketch - Step 2",
    src="/posts/210122/post-sketch-step-02.png" %}

**Step 3:** Open the PDF in Preview and export each page individually as a JPG.

{% post_image tag="span",
    alt="Blog Posts Sketch - Step 3",
    src="/posts/210122/post-sketch-step-03.png" %}

**Step 4:** Open the JPG up in Preview. Crop it and re-save.

{% post_image tag="span",
    alt="Blog Posts Sketch - Step 4",
    src="/posts/210122/post-sketch-step-04.png" %}

Then I have the images I need for the post. And I have the sketches stored digitally in Notability, so if I need to go back and edit at some point, it's no big deal, I just go through all these steps again.

## Why I Like This Approach

On one hand this seems like a lot to jump through just to get a simple sketch on a blog post. But it really gives me everything I want:

- It _feels_ like a sketch, and that's important to me in building a consistent brand.
- It's faster for me to build a sketch with what _feels_ like _doing it by hand_ rather than with a mouse and keyboard.
- It's _relatively_ easy to edit if I need to change something later on.

I had a theory going into last week: the people who can work in the opposite way — bouncing between multiple projects instead of focusing on one — are going to be the ones who produce the most.

So I put it to the test.

## The old way: minimize context switching

If I go back to my last point of obsession — maybe 10 years ago, deep in my Rails days — I was most productive when I was in a hole and shut the world out. I couldn't do it all day, but for three or four hours at a time, that was how I could do the best work. One thing. Crank.

The manual code process became most beneficial with chunks of time in which you could minimize context switching.

## The new theory: maximize context switching

With AI doing the coding, I wondered if the opposite might be true. While the AI is working, I can be thinking about something else. Maybe I could run multiple projects in parallel and actually increase my output.

I spent the better part of two full days absolutely hammering on Claude — further than I've ever pushed it. I was running multiple terminal sessions, bouncing between them, trying to build three or four applications at the same time.

## Three streams is the max

What I found was that four was too many. It was just too many threads of thinking, and there was always some interaction I'd need with the first project before I could get to the fourth one.

With actively standing up applications from scratch — not just adding one little feature, but doing the heavy lifting of building something new — three streams was the max. Two was a little more comfortable most of the time.

## AI handles the code, but you still handle the logic

Here's the thing: there's a lot of work that tools like Claude can do for you. They can do the thinking about the implementation. They can do some planning. But they cannot read your thoughts.

Human thought is erratic. And I really don't think there's a replacement for actually sitting down and thinking about the thing you're trying to build. You don't have to solution it, but you really have to outline the problem and then work with the tool to craft something that makes sense.

So while I'm not writing the code, I'm still holding the logic for all these streams in my head. That's the bottleneck.

## Synchronous work for the MVP

What I'm finding is that in those very early stages — whether it's building or planning — I want to work synchronously. I want to be there, watching, iterating, having quick back and forth until I have a solid foundation.

For my MVP builds, I want to be local, actively engaged. It really helps me think through my process. I feel like I'm moving quickly this way.

Once I get to a place where the basic functionality is there, the visual design I wanted is there, and it's using the tools I want to use — that's when I think we need to switch.

## Then shift to asynchronous

Once the MVP works, that's when I want to move to working asynchronously. The synchronous work is really about being thoughtful about the planning and getting that foundation solid. Then you can start offloading work asynchronously.

There's a lot that can be done asynchronously once you've got that base in place. But trying to do it all asynchronously from the start? That's where things break down.

## What I learned

So yeah, I can increase context switching a little bit compared to the old days. That's partially because I'm not the one doing the coding — and while the coding is happening, I can be thinking about something else.

But there's a limit. Three simultaneous app builds is about where I hit the wall. Four breaks the workflow. The AI handles the code, but I still have to handle the logic for all those streams. And my brain only has so much capacity for that.

I guess we'll find out if that limit changes as the tools get better.

title: When AI coding finally clicked for me

  2025 has been a journey from struggling with the emergence of AI code generators to fully embracing it. From writing almost all the code to almost none of the code.

Somewhere in the middle of the chaos of this dark year, something shifted for me. AI went from feeling like an existential threat to my career to sparking the kind of excitement I hadn't felt in a long time.

## The struggle was real

For the first half of 2025, I was in a real identity crisis. AI tools were exploding everywhere, disrupting everything at this blazing fast pace. People were excited. People were scared. People were mad. Confused.

I didn't know what to think. What to feel. I wasn't really sure what my role in all of this was. Or should be. Or would be.

I'd spent years building up expertise in web development and teaching what I'd learned to others. And then suddenly it felt like anyone could spin up a (really shitty) website without knowing any of that. And my company was working to be on the cutting edge of this revolution. _What did that mean for me?_

The communities I'd been part of for the last several years — the ones that had been so welcoming and inclusive to new developers — were splitting apart. Some folks were all-in on AI. Others were actively hostile to it. I found myself caught in the middle, feeling conflicted about where I stood.

_Was I abandoning the inclusive environments that had welcomed me if I supported AI? Was I on the wrong side of history?_

For months, I struggled to answer these questions. And yet, my job needed me to figure this out. To embrace the change. To help lead the way.

## The moment it clicked

And then I read something. I can't remember now exactly where or what it was. But it provided this spark that began to reframe how I thought about AI and web development.

The insight revolved around _inclusivity_.

Around 2015, another revolution completely redefined what a front-end developer was. Before that, if you were just writing HTML, CSS, and maybe a little JavaScript, people didn't really consider you a developer. You were a designer. Being a developer was an exclusive club, and it was hard to get in.

But then something shifted. Communities formed around the idea that if you're writing front-end code, you're a developer. We started teaching JavaScript to people who'd never programmed before. We widened the definition of what it meant to be a developer.

As I thought back to this shift, I realized that we're going through the exact same thing again.

## History repeating itself

What I started to see what that the same communities that fought to make web development more inclusive 10 years ago were now resisting the change that AI was bringing. They are the ones now gatekeeping the definition of developer.

Look, I get it. There are absolutely valid concerns about AI and code quality and security. This is especially true for folks coming in who don't understand how to evaluate code properly. But that's the opportunity. That's the reason to open the door. Not close it.

## The real opportunity

Once I made this connection, everything changed for me.

I started thinking about all the educational material and teaching that happened between 2015 and 2020. So much of it was just teaching basic patterns and tips and tricks that developers could pick up and use. Helping people who were new to code or coming from a design background level up their skills.

That's exactly where we are again.

Many (maybe _most_) people out there using AI tools have no idea what their AI agent is building for them. They just see that it works. And they don't care how. They're having fun. And that's fine.

But there's also this huge contingent of people who want to build with AI _and_ want to build something serious and scalable with polish.

Those are the people who need new learning paths. They need to understand when to trust the AI output and when to dig deeper. They need to learn patterns and best practices in a world where the tools are fundamentally different.

## What this means for web development

As soon as I saw this, I got excited again. Because this is exactly the kind of challenge I love — figuring out how to teach people new skills in a changing landscape.

I started seeing new opportunities everywhere:

- **New learning paths**: We need to figure out how to teach web development in the age of AI. Not "here's how to write a for loop from scratch," but "here's how to evaluate and improve AI-generated code."
- **Different skill emphasis**: Understanding problems deeply is becoming more valuable than memorizing syntax. Being able to architect solutions and spot issues matters more than typing code.
- **Wider access**: Just like 10 years ago, we're about to see a wave of new developers who come to code through a different path. They are excited and hungry to learn.
- **Opportunities everywhere**: For those of us who are willing to explore and learn in public, there's an endless number of workflows and tools and problems to dig into.

## Moving forward

I'm not saying everyone needs to develop with AI tools. Just like not everyone needs to use React or vanilla CSS or indent with spaces or whatever other technology debate you want to pick. You choose the best tool for the job.

Sometimes the simple tool is the best tool. Carpenters still use hammers every day, even though nail guns exist. It might always be faster to change a line of code than to prompt an AI to do it for you.

I think the right amount of skepticism is healthy and important. But that skepticism was holding me back from the opportunity. Instead, I began to find it more productive to use the skepticism to help developers find the best ways to use AI tools effectively.

## The mission remains the same

There's so much to explore here. And the landscape is changing and evolving almost daily.

That's exciting (to me)!

I've spent years teaching web development and helping people level up their skills. This doesn't make that work irrelevant. It just means the curriculum needs to evolve. The patterns need to adapt. The focus needs to shift a bit.

At my core, my mission remains the same: to help developers build better websites.

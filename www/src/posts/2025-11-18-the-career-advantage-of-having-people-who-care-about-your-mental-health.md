When you ask for career advice, you'll often hear about skills to develop, networks to build, or strategies to climb the ladder. But there's one piece of advice that doesn't get nearly enough attention: **surround yourself with people who genuinely care about your mental health.**

This isn't just feel-good wisdom. It's practical career strategy that can make the difference between burning out and thriving.

## The invisible struggle

Mental health challenges in the workplace are often invisible. You can be accomplishing great things on paper while struggling internally. And when you're in that space, it's incredibly difficult to see your own situation clearly.

The demanding nature of our work makes it easy to normalize struggling. We tell ourselves that everyone feels this way, that it's just part of the job, that we need to push through. But sometimes, pushing through isn't the answer.

## The people who notice

The most valuable colleagues aren't always the ones who help you ship the next feature or close the next deal. Sometimes, the most valuable are the ones who notice when something's off.

These are people in positions of influence who don't just ask "How's the project going?" but "How are _you_ doing?" And more importantly, they create an environment where you feel safe enough to answer honestly.

## Why safety matters

Here's the challenge: when someone in a position of power asks if you're okay, your first instinct is often to say yes, even when you're not. There's risk in vulnerability, especially when your livelihood depends on that person's perception of you.

The best leaders understand this dynamic. They don't just make the offer to talk—they build trust over time that makes taking them up on that offer feel possible.

## A real example

Consider a scenario where you're leading a team and it's not working. Not just "having some challenges" but fundamentally not working—for the company or for you. Your mental health is suffering. You've found some new inspiration in the work, but that spark isn't translating to feeling better as a person.

In that moment, having someone notice and create space for an honest conversation can be transformative. Not a conversation about performance metrics or project deadlines, but about whether the role itself is sustainable for you.

## The power of honest conversations

When you finally have that conversation—when you admit that management might be part of what's weighing you down—it can feel like failure. Especially when it's a role you fought for, a position you thought you wanted.

But here's what matters: being able to have that conversation before you burn out completely. Before it becomes a crisis. Before it affects your work so significantly that you're seen as the problem rather than someone navigating a challenge.

The right people don't see that honesty as weakness. They see it as strength and self-awareness. And they help you find a path forward.

## Beyond just a job change

This isn't about finding people who will help you escape bad situations. It's about finding people who help you navigate complexity.

Maybe that means moving to a different role within the organization. Maybe it means adjusting responsibilities. Maybe it means taking time off. Maybe, sometimes, it does mean moving on.

But having people who care about you as a person—not just as a resource—means you're more likely to find solutions that work for everyone.

## How to find these people

You can't force someone to care about your well-being, but you can:

1. **Look for leaders who demonstrate emotional intelligence:** Do they talk about mental health? Do they model healthy boundaries?

2. **Build genuine relationships:** The colleagues who will look out for you are often the ones you've built trust with over time, not just transactional work relationships.

3. **Pay attention to organizational culture:** Companies that value mental health create environments where these conversations can happen.

4. **Be that person for others:** The best way to build a network of people who care is to genuinely care about others yourself.

## The competitive advantage

In a competitive job market, staying in a role that's not working for you can feel like the safe choice. But having people who create space for honest conversations about fit and well-being gives you something more valuable than job security—it gives you options.

Options to adjust before things become critical. Options to find roles that play to your strengths. Options to advocate for what you need to be successful.

## The bottom line

One of the best career moves you can make isn't about what you know or who you know—it's about surrounding yourself with people who see you as more than your output.

Find the colleagues and leaders who notice when you're struggling. Who create psychological safety for honest conversations. Who help you navigate challenges in ways that prioritize your well-being alongside organizational needs.

Because the truth is, you can't do your best work when you're barely holding it together. And the people who understand that—who actively look out for your mental health—are some of the most valuable people you'll ever work with.

**That's not just good for you. It's good for your career, your team, and the work you're all trying to do together.**

I spent the better part of two full days last week absolutely hammering on Claude code, pushing it further than I ever have before. And something interesting happened. It felt like I had transported myself back to 2014-2015, the peak of my Ruby on Rails development. It was the first time in a long, long time that I felt truly obsessed with what I was doing.

## The head-in-the-sand flow

You know that feeling of being head-in-the-sand, absolutely cranking, hitting walls, and getting frustrated because I want this thing to work and I want it to work right now, but it's not working. I know I needed to tear myself away from the screen, but it was hard to focus fully on anything else. I found myself shirking other life responsibilities just to keep building. I woke up early on Saturday knowing I needed to look at the family budget, but instead I spent three hours building.

There are trade-offs today that weren't there a decade ago. The obsession simply can't take over my life today. I have more responsibilities, and those responsibilities need to be protected. But the energy and the passion was electric, and it's hard to beat that feeling.

I've sensed this level of electricity here and there over the last eight months or so, but this was a whole new level.

## AI as a time machine

Ten years ago, I was most productive when I was in a hole shutting the world out for 3-4 hours at a time. The manual coding process demanded it; you needed those big chunks of time to minimize context switching. If you even had to move at all between projects, you lost the flow state, you lost the context, and boom! It was gone.

The dream with AI writing code for you is that it makes you faster. But for anybody just sitting there working with an agent on one project, it can feel slower even if it's not. It's slower, it's more boring, it's frustrating because you're having to coach this thing through lots of bugs, and it doesn't feel like you're doing that thing. Up until last week, it was still faster for me, but it felt like a lot of downtime, a lot of sitting, waiting, correcting.

What was different last week was that rather than doing something totally different, I basically had three or four projects that I was working on in parallel. So, I would flip between these, and I had to widen my context and accept a level of context switching, but I was doing the same type of work, moving each of these projects in the same direction. So, while one was working, I would go to another and keep that moving.

The flow state looks completely different today. I really hadn't hit that flow state because I was always working on just one thing at a time. The waiting was not context switching; it was the same types of tasks moving in the same direction. It almost feels a little bit like working on multiple features within an app at the same time.

I had thought people who could context switch most effectively are the ones who are most productive with AI tools, but I don't think that's the case. I think it's a different type of context switching and knowing your maximums and being able to go deep on multiple things at the same time to find that perfect balance of time not dictating to you exactly what to write.

## Reigniting the creator flame

The way I built last week is completely different than the way I built Rails applications. I'm not writing any of the code anymore. This was a profound experience for me because it was about remembering why I build.

But what was the same was that I was creating something. Whether using AI or writing code manually, the love isn't necessarily in the process; it's seeing the output of the process, what it brings to life. That's what sparked that feeling of obsession. It's that drive to see something that didn't exist an hour ago.

And while I have to keep that obsession more in check today than I did a decade ago, it's incredible to feel that spark again.

2025 has been a year of contrasts. While it brought significant personal and professional challenges, it also delivered some remarkable achievements worth celebrating.

## Garden wins and growing food

One of the unexpected highlights was progress in the garden. After years of minimal success with growing food, this year finally delivered tangible results. Growing food from seed through to harvest felt absolutely incredible, even if the overall yield remained modest.

The Zulu giant plant flowered — something that seemed unlikely at the start of the year. Beyond that, all the annual flowers came from seed nurtured throughout the winter, creating a lovely garden that attracted monarchs and bees throughout the season.

The learning from this year's gardening efforts provides a foundation to build on in 2026.

## Running a half marathon

Before 2024, running five consecutive miles had happened exactly once. In 2025, that transformed into completing a half marathon.

This represents a significant personal milestone and proof that consistency and dedication pay off, even in areas that initially seem far outside reach.

## Family time and travel

Quality time with family remained a priority throughout the year. A trip to Costa Rica created lasting memories and provided a much-needed reset during a challenging period.

## Professional achievements at Netlify

Two and a half years into the role at Netlify, three major opportunities for improvement became clear:

1. The documentation site needed a visual and organizational refresh
2. Content was scattered across different properties with inconsistent experiences
3. The marketing website and educational content teams operated independently without shared resources

In 2025, two of these challenges were addressed head-on:

**Launched a new documentation site** built on Astro and Starlight, providing a better experience for developers seeking help.

**Created an internal component library** enabling the marketing site and documentation site to share components, establishing a foundation for more cohesive experiences across properties.

While significant work remains, bringing these initiatives to life represents a substantial accomplishment, especially given the broader challenges of the year.

## Speaking and community engagement

After a pandemic-induced pause, 2025 marked a return to in-person conferences. Two conference talks were delivered, and several virtual conferences were hosted. These opportunities to engage with the developer community proved energizing and fulfilling.

## Navigating significant challenges

The achievements above came against a backdrop of considerable difficulty. Three primary challenges defined much of 2025:

### Mental health struggles

Anxiety, which has been manageable since 2016, shifted in intensity and frequency this year. What were once predictable, isolated scenarios became daily occurrences with increased severity.

Addressing this required confronting stigmas around therapy and eventually finding the right therapeutic support. The first week with a new therapist in late 2025 provided more value than three months with the previous one — a reminder that finding the right fit matters.

### The AI identity crisis

The rapid explosion of AI tools created a significant identity crisis for much of the year. The shift felt disruptive and raised difficult questions about purpose, value, and the future of the work that has defined much of the last decade.

By late 2025, a breakthrough reframed this challenge as an opportunity. The web development industry is witnessing another major redefinition of what it means to be a developer — similar to the shift between 2015 and 2020 that broadened the definition to include those writing HTML and CSS.

This new wave isn't about exclusion but expansion. Just as communities welcomed designers into the developer fold a decade ago, there's now an opportunity to welcome a new cohort of builders using AI tools. The challenge and opportunity lie in creating educational paths for those who want to build serious, scalable projects with polish and success.

### Leadership and role challenges

Leading the developer education team at Netlify was incredibly demanding from day one. While there were significant wins — the component library and new documentation site likely wouldn't have happened without this team and leadership — other goals remained elusive.

The combination of role demands and personal challenges made it clear by mid-2025 that something needed to change.

## A significant transition

In late 2025, an honest conversation acknowledged that the management role might not be the right fit at this time. Admitting this felt like failure initially, but it was the right move for personal wellbeing and professional effectiveness.

The developer education team was dissolved, and a return to a developer experience engineering role became the path forward. This new position focuses on:

- Working closely with product managers
- Improving product experience for the emerging cohort of developers
- Creating educational materials that help developers succeed within the Netlify platform

This role combines the technical depth of engineering with the community-facing work that's been most fulfilling over the years. It provides clear measurables for success and aligns with the excitement around the new primitive-level features Netlify is building.

## Looking ahead

The transition late in 2025 brings renewed energy and purpose. The challenges of this year forced growth, honesty, and ultimately a better alignment between role, skills, and passion.

While 2025 was undeniably difficult, the achievements scattered throughout the year demonstrate resilience and progress even in challenging times. The foundation is set for a stronger 2026.

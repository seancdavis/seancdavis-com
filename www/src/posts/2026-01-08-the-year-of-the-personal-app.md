I've generally shied away from predictions lately. Things are changing so fast that it sometimes feels silly to say "this is what's going to happen this year" when it can be hard to predict what's going to happen tomorrow.

But I read [Matt Biilmann's predictions for 2026](https://biilmann.blog/articles/predictions-for-2026/) and it got me thinking about where we're headed. And I have one specific take.

**2026 is the year of the personal app.**

## The problem with software today

When we have a problem that can be solved with software, we generally reach for an existing app. Both the Google Play Store and App Store hit 1 million applications back in 2013. People have been reaching for software to solve specific problems for a long time.

But there have always been two opposing challenges with this model.

**Challenge one:** You find an app that somebody else built, and it either doesn't have everything you need, isn't customizable enough, or requires workarounds to fit your workflow. It's not built _for you_ — it's built for a lot of people _like_ you. You end up adjusting how you work to fit the tool. Even if you're spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on an enterprise solution, it's still probably cheaper than building and maintaining your own. So you deal with it.

**Challenge two:** When there's no app that fits, or it's too expensive, or it's just not quite right, people reach for generic tools. Spreadsheets. Notion databases. Google Docs. These tools offer flexibility, but you either need to be a power user to customize them, or you end up doing a lot of manual work. They're not designed for your specific case. You're just using a generic tool and layering your own process on top.

Neither option is ideal. One forces you to bend to the software. The other forces you to do the work the software should be doing.

## What AI changes

We've seen an explosion in tools like Bolt and Lovable over the last year. People building little projects, silly things, games, basic websites. [I built a candy tracker with my daughter](/posts/my-7-year-old-daughter-built-a-full-stack-application/) in a couple hours. Amazing. We had a specific thing we wanted to do, and we used AI to build an application for it.

But a lot of what's come out of these tools has been just that — demos, experiments, goofy side projects. Not super serious tools.

That's changing.

I'm seeing more and more people really relying on AI to write their code. More converts to this new way of working. As tools like Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini become more capable of building real software, the personal app becomes viable.

It's not just "I can build my own silly little website." It's "I have a problem I need to solve, and now I can build an application specifically designed to enable me to work the way I want to work."

And here's the part that matters most: **as your needs change, you can change the software.** You don't have to bend to the current tool or consider scaling up to some enterprise plan with features you don't need. You just change the software.

On top of that, it's becoming trivial to build custom agents into these applications — automated workflows baked right into tools designed for exactly how you operate.

## Two examples I'm planning to build

I have two projects I want to build on an upcoming live stream. Both are things I currently do in Notion. Both work fine. Neither is ideal.

### Weekly goals

Back in 2020, I started running my personal life in mini sprints. Every week, I create a new entry in Notion with a list of what I want to get done. It's been so effective that I've kept it up for almost five years.

But it's manual. Every Monday I open a new sheet, do a quick retro on the previous week, carry over tasks, delete the ones that didn't make it, start fresh. When new ideas come up mid-week, I have to dump them somewhere — but they end up distracting me from the current week. I don't have a good system for deciding when something should drop off. The retros are messy.

In an hour or less, I could build an application designed for exactly how I handle weekly goals. A clean way to capture upcoming ideas without cluttering the current week. Better data than Notion gives me today. AI that helps me understand how many tasks I should be adding to actually hit my 75% completion target. Suggestions based on history — time of year, patterns from previous weeks. Auto-generated retro summaries that I just edit at the end of each week.

So much opportunity to make this process better, built for exactly how I work.

### Morning songs

Here's a weird one. Almost every day, I wake up with a song stuck in my head. The house is dark and quiet, and there's music playing in my brain.

Years ago, I thought it would be interesting to record these. I actually built a Rails app at one point that would search an API and pull everything into a database. It was a pain to build and maintain, so eventually I moved to Notion.

The current process: go in, find the song on Spotify, embed the Spotify widget, type the song name, type the artist, find the album art, put it all together. It works, but it's tedious. And honestly, building a custom tool to streamline this was never high enough priority to justify the effort.

Now? In one session, I could build an app where I just type a song name — or even some lyrics — and an agent goes and finds the Spotify link, the song title, the artist, the album art. Done. All that data captured with almost no friction. Plus I could build visualizations that are actually interesting to me.

These examples are silly. But they're not pointless. They're useful. That's what I mean by the personal app.

## The web isn't going anywhere

I'm not someone who thinks everything is going to become a chatbot. That's boring, honestly. People like beautiful things. The web and UIs aren't going away anytime soon.

The web is such a powerful platform. And now we have the tools to build exactly what we need on top of it, without the months of effort it used to require.

Notion might remain my backend for some of these things. But standing up custom frontends is becoming trivial. Maintaining them is becoming trivial — when something breaks, you just give the agent the error and let it fix it.

It has me mildly overwhelmed, but mostly excited.

2026. The year of the personal app. Let's build.

There's a lot of hype around AI coding tools right now. You've probably seen it — "Just tell it to make an app and it works!" And that's amazing. It _does_ work, in a lot of cases. Tools like Claude, Bolt, and others have really lowered the barrier to getting something up and running.

But here's the thing: the more you want that something to be _yours_ — the more you want it to actually fit how you work, how you think, the problem _you're_ trying to solve — the more you realize that "make me an app" is just the beginning.

## AI tools can do a lot

I've been hammering on Claude harder than I ever have. And it's incredible what these tools can do. They can handle implementation. They can do some planning. They can research, write code, iterate.

But there's one thing they can't do: read your thoughts.

## Human thought is erratic

And human thought is just kind of erratic. We jump around. We have half-formed ideas. We know what we want but can't always articulate it clearly. We assume context that isn't there.

I really don't think there's a replacement for actually sitting down, taking a moment, and thinking about the thing you're trying to build. You don't have to have the full solution mapped out, but I think you really have to outline the problem. You need to work with the tool to craft a solution that makes sense — and make sure the tool is doing the right research and implementing in a way that you're comfortable supporting.

The prompt you give isn't really the _start_ of the process. It's the _end_ of a thinking process. You've done the work to understand the problem, and the prompt is how you hand that understanding off.

## "Make me an app" works, but ...

AI will work on a broad prompt. It'll give you something. And for a lot of people, that's enough — especially early on. But if you want to make it something unique to you, it's going to need a lot of honing.

You'll start to see this through smaller, incremental steps. The AI does something. You adjust. It does something else. You realize you need to answer a question you hadn't considered. And eventually, you have a lot of questions to answer if you really want to get something working the way you want.

## Product thinking still matters

People who have built products in the past are still in a unique position. We can do more of that deeper thinking upfront — the kind of thinking that enables the agent to be more successful from the start. We can shape an MVP without getting bogged down by implementation details.

What we have now is really the need to be a product manager. I've been thinking a lot about this lately: yeah, we're all developers, but we're also all product managers. And the folks with the best combination of those skills are going to be the most successful in the current world.

## The pre-code phase isn't going away

I think there's a misconception that AI removes the need for planning. That you can just start prompting and iterate your way to something great.

And you _can_ do that. But you'll get there faster — and with better results — if you do the thinking first. Outline the problem. Understand what you're actually trying to build. Get clear on the constraints and tradeoffs.

Then hand it off.

The "pre-code" phase isn't going away. It's just that now, instead of writing the code yourself, you're writing the prompt. And that prompt should be the final step of a real thinking process — not the first.

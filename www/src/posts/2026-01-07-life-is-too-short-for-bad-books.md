I don't think you should finish a bad book.

That doesn't mean you shouldn't _start_ bad books — there's no way to avoid that. But once you realize a book isn't working for you, put it down. Life is too short to slog through something you're not enjoying.

## Getting back into reading

I never really had a reading habit until early 2020. I'd taken an American Lit course in college that forced me to read a lot, and I loved a few of those books. But reading was never really a hobby of mine.

Then, for whatever reason, I got a library card and picked up _All Quiet on the Western Front_. A weird choice for getting back into reading, but I really enjoyed it. The pandemic made it easy to keep the momentum going. And it's stuck with me ever since.

It helps that my wife and dad are both big readers. Being around it makes the habit easier to maintain.

## The problem with finishing everything

When I started reading regularly, I wanted to track the books I'd read. I used a simple one-to-five star scale and would rate each book when I finished it, jotting down a few paragraphs about how I felt.

Over those first couple years, I rated a few books two stars. This happened in two scenarios:

The first was high literature that I could tell was technically impressive but was a complete slog to get through. I didn't really understand what I was reading. I didn't enjoy it. I finished it anyway, thinking it was written for professors and not me.

The second was the Chamber of Secrets. Look, I know Harry Potter is beloved, but that book felt like a copy-paste of the first one with a few words changed. It was only entertaining because the first book was entertaining.

Here's what I realized: I should have never finished those books. I spent weeks on some of them and enjoyed almost none of that process.

## A scale that starts at three

My dad and I were talking about how we rate books, and I realized his scale is completely different from mine. He's really withholding of five stars. I'm more generous — if a book moved me, I thought it was decent literature, and I moved through it quickly because it was engaging, that's the highest achievement.

But the real insight wasn't about the top of the scale. It was about the bottom.

I revised my rating system so that I cannot rate anything lower than three stars. This simple change unlocked a few things for me.

### No more wasted time

If a book can't be rated lower than three, then I can't finish a book that's less than three. This forces me to recognize one-star and two-star books early in the process and put them down.

There isn't quite an infinite number of books out there, but there's more than enough that I could never possibly consume them all in my lifetime. Why spend any time on something I'm not enjoying?

That doesn't mean avoiding books that are hard to get through. I'm in the middle of one right now that I've been reading for over a month because it's dense and not fast-paced. But I'm enjoying it. I think it's really good. That's different from forcing myself through something I actively don't like.

### Three is clearly defined

Three stars becomes the worst book that's worth finishing. It's not great, but it was worth my time. That's a meaningful distinction.

### The crucial half-stars

The other thing this change did was add 3.5 and 4.5 to my scale. This matters more than you'd think, especially toward the top.

Before, four was a massive category. It was everything between "worst book worth finishing" and "best of the best." That's too broad to be useful. I found myself nudging some books up to five when they probably didn't deserve it, just because four felt like such a wide bucket.

Now, 4.5 gives me a way to distinguish between books that were really great and books I feel passionate about recommending. When I rate something 4.0 or less, I probably won't actively recommend it. It's not a bad book — threes are still worth finishing — but I'm not going to push it on people.

The 4.5s? I feel passionate about almost every one of them. I just want a way to separate them from the books that bring _everything_ together.

## Permission to put it down

Here's the thing that might be hardest to accept: just because somebody else said a book was a four or five doesn't mean it will even be worth finishing for you.

People have different levels of understanding when it comes to literature. They also have different experiences and interests that affect how entertaining or engaging a book will be for them. A book that changed someone's life might bore you to tears. That's fine.

There can be a layer of guilt when you return a book to the library after only reading 100 pages. When something just fizzles out and you quietly set it aside.

Fuck it.

Life is too short to read bad books. If it's not working for you, put it down. There's another book waiting.

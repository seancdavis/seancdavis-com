NPM is the primary [package manager](/posts/wtf-is-a-package-manager/) for the [JavaScript](/posts/wtf-is-javascript/) programming language. It acts as both the registry and also provides command-line tooling. It is considered [the world's largest software registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/).

NPM serves both front-end code — JavaScript packages meant to be run in the browser – and back-end code — Node.js libraries.

While there appear to be alternatives to NPM, like [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), they typically are only providing the command-line tooling, but actually use NPM as the registry, or the source of the packages.

You can learn more about NPM on [its website](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/).

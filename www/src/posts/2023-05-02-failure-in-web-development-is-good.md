  I have to remind myself â€” don't be afraid to fail! It's part of learning and

As web developers, we're always striving for success. We want to build amazing websites that wow our clients and users.

But what happens when we fail? Failure can be scary and discouraging. And yet, it's a natural part of the learning process.

## Learning from Failure

Sure, you can learn from success, but you learn from failure faster.

When something goes wrong, you're forced to dig deeper and figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. This can be a painful process, but the lessons you learn will stick with you for a long time. You'll become a better developer because of it.

### Varying Degrees of Failure

This can mean little things like fixing a bug. You're usually going to learn a lot more about the code or the language/tooling by figuring why something isn't working.

And it can also mean something more drastic, like taking down production with the wrong SQL query, or sending a test email to thousands of users (I've done that). These hurt more in the moment, but typically offer more learning as a result.

## Something Good Comes from Failure

Something good usually comes from failure. It may not be obvious at first, but if you keep an open mind and look for the silver lining, you'll find it.

Maybe your failed project taught you a new skill or introduced you to a new tool. Maybe it led you to a better project or a new opportunity. Maybe you met someone during the process who will become an instrumental part of your career.

You never know what good things can come from failure, which is a great motivator for not fearing it.

## Getting into Action Sooner

The key to dealing with failure is to not let its potential stop you. The earlier you get into action, the faster you'll learn and the faster you'll find success.

If you're constantly waiting for the perfect project or the perfect idea, you'll never get started. This has happened to me numerous times throughout my career. And, almost every time, once I got started, the learning started immediately.

Embrace the uncertainty and take that first step.

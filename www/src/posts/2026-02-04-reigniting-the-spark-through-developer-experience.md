2025 was a hard year for me. While I'm sure it can get a lot worse (knocks on wood), much of it was a struggle.

And yet, there were some really incredible things that happened along the way.

## Finding wins in a tough year

Before I get into the hard stuff, I want to celebrate some of the bigger wins that happened last year. Most of which past me would not have thought possible, or at least probable.

### Becoming a runner

Before 2024, I had only run five consecutive miles once in my life. In 2025, I trained in the cold, the dark, the rain. I overcame multiple injuries. And I ran a half marathon, blowing my goal time out of the water.

That felt huge. I'm still proud of that. And I'm looking to run four half marathons this year.

### Nurturing flowers and food

The COVID pandemic helped spark in me a transition from a mild interest in plants to a mild obsession with plants. The last five years have been a series of small improvements and learning a lot about plants — mostly through failure.

Last year, that work started to pay off. I nurtured a small Zulu Giant plant to eventually flower, which is something I've been trying to do for years without success.

I also ate food from plants that I grew from seeds. It wasn't a lot, and you could look at that venture as cost-prohibitive and mostly a failure. But I learned enough that I walked away from the season not discouraged, but with a long list of notes and ideas on how to really make the garden fruitful in 2026.

### Celebrating 10 years of marriage

My wife and I took a trip without kids to Costa Rica for a week to celebrate our 10-year wedding anniversary (a year late). While there were some missteps and challenges along the way, it's the exact type of adventure we love to take together — in a corner of the world that is spectacular and unlike anything else I've ever experienced.

I aim to go right back there as soon as I fix myself up enough to be fully immersed in the experience.

### Shipping big things at Netlify

I regularly think about how lucky I am to be at Netlify and how hard I've worked to get here. And I think it's easy to overlook what's getting shipped when we're moving so fast.

But my team delivered on three things that I've been working toward since I walked in that door.

First is a new doc site. The day I started at Netlify, I could tell the doc site was wildly out of date, difficult to manage, and simply unsustainable. And yet we kept trucking along. It took two years, but we rebuilt the thing from the ground up.

Second, also in those early days, I found it a bit silly that the doc site and the marketing site were handled independently. I aimed to navigate the org in a way that I could remedy that. It also took about two years and several organizational shifts before we could make it a reality. We stood up an internal component library that is now used for both the documentation site and the marketing site. And the same set of developers maintain both today.

Third, as we moved on from putting on our own conferences, I saw an opportunity to show up big out in the community. We identified Render Atlanta as that place. And without breaking the bank, we built out the show's most popular booth — an immersive arcade experience — for a fraction of the cost that the biggest sponsors took on.

## The clouds of confusion

Despite those pretty substantial wins, I was struggling. It still felt like there was a cloud hanging over me, preventing all of these things from feeling like the overwhelming and runaway successes that they were.

I attribute this to several factors.

### A spike in anxiety

My mental health tanked last year. I've known anxiety was a thing for me since 2016. But in 2025, it shifted from isolated, predictable scenarios to a daily struggle. Every day was hard. (That is still the case, but I'm working on it.)

On the positive side, I'm doing something about it. Some of the spikes that I felt throughout the year have prompted real action from me instead of just sweeping things under the rug. This is the year that I truly address those things head on — not just on the side, but making them a priority.

### A developer identity crisis

For the first several months of the year, it felt like my whole working world was being disrupted at an alarming rate. I didn't know where I fit in anymore. I didn't know whether to hang with the humans I've had connections with who feared and bashed AI, or to jump on the train and embrace it, try it, struggle with it, and form an opinion about where our industry was going.

That was the first six months of the year. During that third quarter is when I really experienced a shift in that feeling. I'll touch on that more below.

### Political tensions

Look, I really don't want to get into it here. Suffice it to say, it's hard to operate at full capacity when you feel like your leaders are actively dismantling the structure that has held your life in place. It's hard to not be angry. It's hard to not read and stay informed on the things that make me angrier.

## Reigniting the spark

By midsummer, I had reached a low point. I needed to address my mental health with more of a priority and a sense of urgency. And I needed to make an adjustment to what every day looked like, which started with work.

For most people in a similar position — and for me throughout my entire career — that answer meant finding a new job. But while I knew something was not right and not sustainable, jumping to another organization just didn't feel like the right move.

In short, it felt like I might end up carrying that baggage to a new place. And when that honeymoon period wore off, I'd be in the same spot or worse. Something more foundational needed to be addressed.

### Finding support

While I was working through this struggle, two leaders at Netlify had noticed something was off. Both approached me individually at different times — not to pressure me, but to offer support.

They made exploring creative conversations feel like a safe place, which is a rare and precious thing. Often, I think people don't explore what could end up being the best option out of fear.

And I was scared. But I decided to put my faith in myself and take the risk, understanding that if it went wrong, I would still be okay.

### Reframing AI

While I was navigating this, I found a spark. It came from reframing how I looked at AI in the developer community.

Up until then, I had been conflicted. The inclusive communities I love — the ones that said "not everyone is a developer, but everyone is welcome" — seemed to be rejecting AI. My conflict was that if I embraced AI, was I also abandoning the values embedded in the communities that I adored?

But then an idea struck me. AI is the gate through which a whole new generation of builders are going to enter the scene.

The communities that had pushed against the gatekeeping of what it meant to be a _real_ developer — the ones who had helped completely redefine what it meant to be a developer, to be more technical, to be more capable, to ship more code — were now themselves becoming the gatekeepers of this industry.

I started to see that the opportunity was very clearly not in resisting AI, but instead in educating this new generation of builders.

That realization gave me my purpose back. I [wrote about it](/posts/ai-coding-finally-clicked/) after it started to feel real.

And still, even with that spark, I wasn't seeing an improvement in my mental health. I felt the excitement about the work coming back, but I still didn't feel good as me.

### Making a hard decision

So I went back to those two leaders and decided to explore those conversations. What the three of us determined across multiple individual conversations was that, for whatever reason, this team wasn't right.

Those conversations were scary. I had to put a lot of faith in myself that I maybe didn't really feel at the time to even explore them.

What came out of them was really hard to accept. Admitting that these two folks were right felt like a failure. I couldn't manage this team and figure out how to make this team successful within this organization.

The reality is that's probably not true. I've been a manager in the past and a successful one. But a combination of all the variables in this situation — the time, the place, the people — all of the things came together, and we realized it doesn't matter _why_ it's not right. It's just not right.

And I knew I needed a change anyways. So in what felt like a mutual decision, we decided to transition me away from management and to dissolve the team I was leading.

I moved back into a role as an independent contributor — a Developer Experience Engineer. While the role wasn't explicitly defined beyond a set of bullet points on a job description, it felt more like what I had been doing for years and where I really thrived. It's what I love.

Navigating ambiguity is a place that I'm comfortable. I'm an engineer and an educator at heart. And with this all happening around the same time as that spark returned, it felt like I could really truly find the time to run with it.

## Looking forward

Today I'm working closely with the product and marketing teams to improve the experience for this new cohort of developers, building foundational tools that offer endless opportunities for building custom AI workflows.

I am pumped. I am energized.

I still have a lot of work to do on me. And a very long way to go on this mental health journey, and in navigating all the complexities of my life today.

But I am excited to be back doing what I do best — tinkering, building, teaching. I am endlessly appreciative of the two people who really helped make this happen for me. And I'm proud of myself for building up the courage to explore the possibility.

So here we go. Let's build.

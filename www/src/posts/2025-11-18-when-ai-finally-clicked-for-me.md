2025 has been a challenging year for me. But somewhere in the middle of all that chaos, something shifted. AI went from feeling like an existential threat to my career to sparking the kind of excitement I haven't felt in years.

Let me tell you about that shift — because I think we're in the middle of something bigger than most people realize.

## The struggle was real

For the first seven or eight months of this year, I was in a real identity crisis. AI tools were exploding everywhere, disrupting everything at this blazing fast pace. And honestly, it left me questioning what the hell my role was anymore.

I'd spent years building up expertise in web development, learning patterns, understanding best practices, teaching others. And then suddenly it felt like anyone could spin up a website without knowing any of that. What did that mean for me? For people like me?

The communities I'd been part of — the ones that had been so welcoming and inclusive to new developers — were splitting apart. Some folks were all-in on AI. Others were actively hostile to it. And I found myself caught in the middle, feeling conflicted about where I stood.

Was I abandoning the inclusive environments that had welcomed me if I supported AI? Was I on the wrong side of history?

For months, I didn't have a good answer.

## The moment it clicked

And then I read something. I honestly can't even remember if it was an article or just a post somewhere. But it provided this spark that completely reframed how I was thinking about AI and web development.

The insight was about inclusivity.

Think back about 10 years ago. There was this revolution that completely redefined what a front-end developer was. Before that, if you were just writing HTML and CSS, people didn't really consider you a developer. You were a designer. It was kind of an exclusive club.

But then something shifted. Communities formed around the idea that if you're writing HTML and CSS, you're a developer. Full stop. We started teaching JavaScript to people who'd never programmed before. We widened the definition of what it meant to be a developer.

Here's what I realized: **We're going through the exact same thing again.**

## History repeating itself

Those same communities that fought to make web development more inclusive 10 years ago? Many of them were now putting guardrails back on the definition of developer.

"You're not a real developer if you're just using AI to write code."

"You need to understand fundamentals."

"AI is a threat to the craft."

Look, I get it. There are absolutely valid concerns about AI and code quality. When your job involves a very specific level of polish, AI can't really do that today. Maybe it will someday. Maybe not. I don't need to know, and I think making predictions along those lines is a fucking waste of time.

But here's the thing: **the definition of developer is going to change whether those communities have anything to say about it or not.**

## The real opportunity

Once I flipped that in my head, everything changed.

I started thinking about all the educational material and teaching that happened between 2015 and 2020. So much of it was just teaching basic patterns and tips and tricks that developers could pick up and use. Helping people who were new to code or coming from a design background level up their skills.

**That's exactly where we are again.**

Yeah, there are people out there using AI tools who have no idea what the hell their AI agent is building for them. They just see that it works. But there's also this huge contingent of people who want to build with AI _and_ want to build something serious and scalable with polish.

Those are the people who need new learning paths. They need to understand when to trust the AI output and when to dig deeper. They need to learn patterns and best practices in a world where the tools are fundamentally different.

## What this means for web development

This shift opened up so much for me:

**New learning paths**: We need to figure out how to teach web development in the age of AI. Not "here's how to write a for loop from scratch," but "here's how to evaluate AI-generated code and improve it."

**Different skill emphasis**: Understanding problems deeply is becoming more valuable than memorizing syntax. Being able to architect solutions and spot issues matters more than typing speed.

**Wider access**: Just like 10 years ago, we're about to see a wave of new developers who come to code through a different path. And that's exciting.

**Opportunities everywhere**: For those of us who are willing to explore and learn in public, there's just an endless amount of workflows and tools and problems to dig into.

## Moving forward

I'm not saying everyone needs to develop with AI tools. Just like not everyone needs to use React or write their own CSS or whatever other technology debate you want to pick. You choose the best tool for the job.

Sometimes the simple tool is the best tool. Carpenters still use hammers every day, even though nail guns exist.

But for those of us who are tasked with figuring out the new shit and being on the forefront of everything? We should be open to it all. Our job isn't to be skeptical of everything. It's to figure out where these tools are most applicable and how we can help people use them successfully.

## The work ahead

There's so much to explore here. We're building these new primitive-level features and tools that enable people to do some crazy, wacky shit. The landscape is constantly changing and evolving.

And that's what got me excited again.

It's not about AI replacing developers. It's about AI changing what it means to be a developer — just like we've seen happen before. **And there's massive opportunity in being part of shaping what that new definition looks like.**

I've spent years teaching web development and helping people level up their skills. This doesn't make that irrelevant. It just means the curriculum needs to evolve. The patterns need to adapt. The focus shifts a bit.

But at its core, it's the same mission: helping people build things on the web successfully, whatever that looks like in 2025 and beyond.

And honestly? I can't wait to see where this goes.

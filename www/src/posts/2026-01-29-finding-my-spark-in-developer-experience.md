I'm going to come out and say it: 2025 was, for the most part, a really hard year for me.

I look back on it and think, "Wow, that was a complete shit year." And yet, there were some incredible things that happened along the way.

## Finding the wins in a tough year

Before I get into the hard stuff, I want to call out the wins. Because even in a year where my mental health tanked, I accomplished things I didn't think were possible.

**I became a runner.** Before 2024, I had only run five consecutive miles once in my life. In 2025, I ran a half marathon. That felt huge.

**I connected with the earth.** I made progress on my yard, learned a ton about plants, and finally got my Zulu Giant to flower. I even grew food from seed that I actually ate. It wasn't a massive harvest, but it was enough to feel that sense of accomplishment.

**We traveled.** I took my family to Costa Rica, which was an incredible experience.

**We shipped big things at work.** When I started at Netlify, I saw opportunities to improve the docs and unify our web properties. This year, we launched a new documentation site on Astro and Starlight, and an internal component library shared between our marketing and doc sites.

But despite these wins, I was struggling.

## The perfect storm

I attribute the difficulty of 2025 to a combination of factors that all came to a head over the summer.

First, **my mental health took a nose dive.** I've known anxiety was a thing for me since around 2016, but in 2025, it shifted from isolated, predictable scenarios to a daily struggle. It got severe.

Second, the **explosion of AI** led to a real identity crisis. For the first several months of the year, I felt like everything was being disrupted at a blazing pace, and I didn't know where I fit in anymore.

Third, **my role.** I was leading the Developer Education team. It was a great opportunity, and we achieved some big wins, but the role—combined with my lifestyle—didn't leave space for me to tinker, explore, or find the inspiration I desperately needed to navigate the AI shift.

And on top of that, the **political climate** and the state of the government added a layer of existential dread that made it hard to focus.

By August, I was in a low spot. I felt like I was in crisis mode. I was asking myself, "What am I doing? Where do I go from here?"

## The spark

I was weighing my options: move to a new company as an engineer, try to take time off (not really an option), or find a new path at Netlify.

Two leaders at Netlify had noticed I wasn't myself. They reached out, not to pressure me, but to offer support. They made it safe for me to be honest, which is a rare and precious thing when your performance is tied to your livelihood.

While I was navigating this, I found a spark. It came from reframing how I looked at AI and the developer community.

For a while, I felt conflicted. The inclusive communities I loved—the ones that said "everyone is a developer"—seemed to be rejecting AI. It felt like a split. If I embraced AI, was I abandoning those values?

But then I realized: **AI is just the next expansion of what it means to be a developer.**

Ten years ago, we had gatekeepers telling HTML/CSS writers or WordPress users they weren't "real" developers. We fought to change that definition. Now, we're seeing a new wave of people building software with AI tools, and the gatekeeping is happening again.

The opportunity isn't in resisting AI; it's in **educating this new generation of builders.** It's about helping them go from "this works" to "this is scalable, polished, and successful."

That realization gave me my purpose back.

## Returning to my roots

Even with this new inspiration, I realized that my mental health wasn't improving. I was excited about the work, but I still didn't feel good *as me*.

I had to be honest with myself and my leadership: **Management wasn't working for me.**

Admitting that felt like failure. I wanted to be able to do it all. But I knew that if I wanted to be successful—and healthy—I needed a change. I told those leaders, "I think part of the problem is that I shouldn't be managing this team right now."

We decided to dissolve the Developer Education team, and I moved into a role as a **Developer Experience Engineer**.

This is what I've done for years. It's what I love. I'm an engineer at heart. I love getting deep into the weeds, building primitives, and figuring out how to enable other developers to do crazy, wacky, amazing things.

I'm working closely with product and marketing to improve the experience for this new cohort of developers. I'm building foundational tools that offer endless opportunities for workflows.

I am pumped.

I'm appreciative of the people who helped me make this shift, and I'm excited to be back to doing what I do best: tinkering, building, and teaching.

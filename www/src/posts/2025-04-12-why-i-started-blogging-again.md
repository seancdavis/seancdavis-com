Writing is one of those things that is easy to put off. There's always something more urgent, something that feels more productive, trying to steal the time I use for writing. It takes constant vigilance to keep the guardrails in place to protect that time.

When I let those distractions win once, it's harder to prevent them from winning again. Because I don't just need to maintain the guardrails, I need to build new ones.

And yet, when I finally put the energy into rebuilding, I wonder why I ever stopped writing.

## My two-year hiatus

As I mentioned in [an exploration of my blogging history](/posts/my-blogging-history/), I hit a wall in 2023. I took on a demanding side project that ate up the free time I had, which was much less than it used to be, given the tiny humans running around in my house.

At the time, I had drafts sitting around, and a never-ending list of ideas, but none of them excited me enough to protect the time I needed to write.

I even tried tricks like using AI and voice transcription tools, thinking technology could help me push through. But that wasn't the answer. The tools were (and still are) tools, not a replacement for the craft of writing.

Leading a developer education team didn't help either. While I was writing at work, I wasn't spending the same amount of time I was when I was a DX engineer at Stackbit. And the work I was doing in leading the team wasn't feeding the creative energy that usually fueled my blog post topics.

## Rebuilding the writing guardrails

A void in my life recently became noticeable. I needed to create something. Since taking on the task of leading a team, I hadn't been able to spend my days creating like I used to.

And yet, I couldn't just jump right back into writing. I needed the fuel for the content. And I needed to rebuild the guardrails on my time.

### Starting with a side project

The first thing I did was start exploring new side projects. So far, this has meant digging into new tools and new takes on old ideas.

Even in the exploration phase, I'm learning and creating. That's enough to bring life back to that never-ending list of ideas.

### Leveraging the industry chaos

The other thing that has helped fuel ideas is the current chaotic state of web development. We're at a fascinating inflection point. We're seeing rapid changes in how we build and deliver software.

Back in 2020, it seemed like there was a new JavaScript framework or developer tool every week. Now, it seems like there's a new AI-driven tool weekly (or sometimes daily).

The problems are the same, but the tools we can use to solve them are rapidly changing, creating new gaps and perspectives to explore. It's another great source of ideas.

### Making the time by starting small

The challenge with rebuilding the guardrails for writing time today is that I'm now using that "free time" (which is super limited these days) to work on the side project.

The solution for me (so far) has been to start small. My new mantra in life is: _low expectations, high hopes_. Rather than assuming I'm going to crank out five posts a week, I set my goal at one.

That's it. One post each week. That's enough to keep me motivated to keep writing.

## Benefits of regular writing

Right away, I've noticed a few benefits of regular writing. These are the things that typically push me through potential lulls.

### 1. Sharpen communication skills

This one's obvious but crucial. Written communication dominates our professional lives, especially in the remote, asynchronous world of software development. Regular blogging helps me develop a clearer, more effective voice.

### 2. Understand problems more deeply

Teaching often leads to deeper understanding than purely doing. This is especially relevant in the age of AI. While we may eventually reach a point where code implementation details matter less, we're not there yet. Understanding and explaining problems clearly is becoming more valuable than ever.

### 3. Discover what really matters

Writing is like reading — you don't have to do it, but you choose to for the benefits. And if one book (or post) isn't working, you can stop and pick up something else.

When I consistently write, I naturally gravitate toward topics that genuinely interest me. And in that way, I learn what I really care about (and what I should be ignoring).

### 4. Build confidence through vulnerability

Putting your thoughts out in public is scary. But every time I do it, I gain a little confidence. It's a great way to combat impostor syndrome.

### 5. Deep thought in a distracted world

It's too easy to get distracted these days. When I sit down to write about something specific, close off the distractions and really dig in, I often uncover far more than I expected. (And even those discoveries can become seeds for future posts.)

### 6. The website-idea-content loop

When I get back into writing, I spend more time with my website. That makes me want to keep it fresh, which leads to tinkering, which leads to more content ideas. It's a beautiful cycle of creativity and improvement.

### 7. Create your digital presence

My site and blog are a big part of my professional identity. It has created opportunities and opened doors for me. Keeping it fresh is like keeping a resume up to date — anyone can see the work I'm doing and the approach I'm taking to the problems I'm solving.

## Just start writing!

While you may not experience all the same benefits, I suspect that if you get started, you'll find your own reasons to keep writing. And some of them are likely to overlap with those I've listed above.

So, do it! Put something out there! Don't overthink every post — then writing feels like a chore.

A personal blog isn't about perfection — it's about practice. Start writing, keep writing, and you'll naturally find your voice and rhythm over time. **The only way to get better is to begin.**

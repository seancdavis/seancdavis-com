I never thought I'd call myself a runner. For most of my life, running was something I did on the way to doing something else—chasing a ball, getting to a base, avoiding a tackle. Running for the sake of running? That was never the plan.

## Growing Up in Sports

I played sports through high school and was decent at it. The practices were brutal, though. Running was always the punishment, the conditioning, the thing we had to endure before we got to the good stuff. I ran track as a sprinter, but cross country never appealed to me.

There's a story about trying out for the high school baseball team that still sticks with me. The tryout required running five miles in 35 minutes—seven-minute miles on a closed course. For baseball. A sport where you can be overweight and successful, where running is maybe the fourth or fifth most important skill. A friend who couldn't come close to that time made the team because he was a left-handed pitcher, which the team needed.

That kind of thing shapes how you see running. It was never something I did for enjoyment.

## Something Shifted

Over the years, I picked up running occasionally and always put it back down. It hurt. Breathing was hard. My body ached. There was no joy in it, just a means to an end—usually burning calories or trying to get in better shape.

Then, in August 2024, something changed. I went for a run without really knowing why. It still hurt. Breathing was still hard. I only made it about two miles. But my brain quieted down in a way it hadn't before.

The pain became an outlet. I could shut off the constant mental chatter and focus on how my body felt. It wasn't fun, exactly, but it was interesting. It felt like a mental health practice disguised as exercise.

## Getting Serious

I registered for a 7K race—about four and a half miles. After finishing that, I experimented with longer distances. The first time I ran five miles, I came home and just stood there for a moment, catching my breath, thinking: I've never done that before by choice.

For someone who had never willingly run that far, it felt like a massive accomplishment. And that's when I realized this could be sustainable.

I started talking to runners I knew, asking for advice. Two things changed everything:

1. **Get proper shoes.** I'd been putting this off, but it matters.
2. **You don't have to go fast.** Learning to slow down, control my breathing, and manage my heart rate transformed the experience.

## Setbacks Along the Way

Right after I finally bought real running shoes—right when I was getting serious—my knee started hurting. I remember a run over the Christmas holiday at my in-laws' house where I had to stop at four miles because the pain was too much.

A doctor visit and a few weeks off later, I learned I needed to switch up the muscles I was using. It took time and several painful runs to get back on track.

I also dealt with a surprising amount of anxiety before runs. Figuring out the right time of day, what to eat, how to plan my week—it all took trial and error. I started planning my runs two weeks out, with a long run each week and a gradual increase in total mileage.

## Race Day

By the time race day arrived, I was ready. I'd run 12 miles once and 11 miles another time. My plan was conservative—nine-minute miles, finish in about two hours.

I blew that out of the water.

The race itself was a completely different experience than a 5K. The energy, the distance, the accomplishment at the end—it was an order of magnitude different. I set a distance PR, and I already know I'll do a marathon someday. Not immediately, but it's on the horizon.

## What Running Means Now

I've changed over the past several months. Something that started as a way to quiet my brain has become a practice I genuinely look forward to. There's a part of me now that didn't exist before—a runner's identity that still feels strange to claim.

I'm not going to over-analyze it. I'm just going to keep running, keep learning, and enjoy the process. One or two races a year feels right. A marathon eventually. And whatever else the journey brings.

The hills don't intimidate me anymore. I learned the right skills, and they're manageable now. That's probably a metaphor for something, but I'll leave that alone.

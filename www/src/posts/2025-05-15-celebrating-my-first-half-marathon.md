## Sports Kid, Not a Runner

I grew up playing sports and it was pretty decent. I like doing that, you know? I really did not like running over the years in high school sports. It was a lot of work, and it wasn't really fun until, you know, I could get the chance to play in front of a crowd. Once I was one of the better players in my position, once I knew that I would get some playing time in front of crowds, it was great.

I also ran track; I was a sprinter. We never ran cross country; I was never interested in it. To me, running was more like a thing I did while I was doing something else. And so I never really ran distances, just sprinted short distances all the time.

Let's talk about trying out for the baseball team in high school. We want to unpack the baggage of why I didn't make that and how it basically turns very quickly into bullshit politics.

So anyways, well actually just spend a minute on the bullshit politics because it plays a role. I ultimately didn't make the team, and if there's one thing I have a problem with, it's people who are not willing to admit their hypocrisies because we all live with them, some to more of an extent than others.

One of those things was this apparent requirement that to be able to compete in the trial, the first thing you had to do that they would use to weed everybody out is you had to be able to run five miles in 35 minutes. But that's seven-minute miles, no stoplights, just closed course, 5 miles, 35 minutes. Now, the rational person says, how the fuck would you do that? It's baseball. You don't need endurance to play baseball. It's one of the few professional sports where you can actually be overweight and successful.

You don't even have to be good at running if you're good at other things in baseball. So it was a requirement, and we found that out because I think my friends at the time, it wasn't even close. I mean somewhere between 48 and low 50s, you know, it wasn't even about 35 minutes. But he was a left-handed pitcher and the team needed that, so he made the team clearly.

Anyways, long-winded backstory to say that I never liked running. And before August of 2024, I never ran more than five miles except for that one time.

## Something Changed

Over the years, I've picked up running and I've put it down because it's never fun. It's always like I start doing it for some reason that is a means to something else, and it hurts. It's not fun. I have trouble breathing; my body hurts, you know? I don't actually think about anything. I don't enjoy that time. I do it to whatever, burn calories, whatever.

Well, in August 2024, I don't even exactly remember why, but I went for a run. I don't remember why I started; I just remember what happened. Something was different. It still hurt. Still was really hard to breathe. I didn't go far, maybe around two miles. But it was one of the most interesting test plans in the world. Really, really good.

That pain was a great outlet. I could shut my brain in for a minute. I could focus on the pain and the way my body felt. It still wasn't fun, but I started to make it interesting. It felt like a mental health outlet. I could just focus on my body. I could put my energy into this thing. And it felt good because of that.

But it wasn't at a point where it was going to be self-sustaining, right? It's like any other practice of meditation or something like that, where it's solving the problem in the moment but eventually it will fade. But I stuck with it while it was solving that particular problem, and it was good, you know? It felt good when I would finish running, and so I started just doing it more regularly.

## Moving Forward

I registered for this race where I had to run a 7k, which is four and a half miles. There was a lot of energy after that. I experimented a few times with some longer distances, and I still remember the first time I did five miles. Coming back and catching my breath, I just took a moment and said, holy shit, you've never done that before by choice, and you just did it.

I mean, for someone who has never run five miles, running five miles is a massive feat. I was running fast, but you know, that's not only 20, 30, 60 miles of continuous work. And so it was starting to hit me like, oh, this could be a sustainable thing.

But I knew it was building off of these milestones and moments of climbing up and achieving things. I mean, eventually that would wear off, so I just started talking to people I knew, good runners, about what I was feeling and what I was doing, and I got a lot of unsolicited advice.

The two main things that happened in this fall were: get proper shoes and you don't have to go fast. You don't have to learn if you go at all. Learning how to breathe and control your heart rate, you slow down. And so I did, and that was what changed.

## Setbacks and Finding My Groove

We did a turkey trot, and I kept running a little bit, not really sure what I was doing, just kind of enjoying learning how to control a little bit better so that I could up the pace, you know, and conquer some of these hills. It was a crazy feeling.

Around Christmas, I finally bit the bullet and got shoes, because I should have gotten shoes. I was like, okay, I'm serious, I'm going to take it serious, I'm going to keep going.

But then, not like a week or so after that, I get hurt and my knee starts hurting. I remember a weekend after Christmas, taking this run at my wife's parents' house, just like in so much pain at the end of four miles. It was bad enough that I was like, I can't run anymore.

Before that had happened, I had to go into the doctor for something else. I was talking to him about running, and I said, well, it's really hard to breathe. Is there anything I can do? And so, that was a game changer for me for a while. I was still running but it was easier than it had ever been.

Then after I got hurt, I had to wait like three weeks to get into the doctor. He told me I had to switch up the muscles I was using. It took another couple weeks before I went out again and it was painful for a few runs but after a while, it's getting slightly manageable with the pain. It's enjoyable.

I had quite a bit of anxiety with runs. I really went through that. It really took a lot figuring out how to be comfortable ahead of time, what time to go. I started planning two weeks out – total miles every week and a long run running more than the second longest. And slowly the anxiety got better, figured out what time worked better.

## The Half Marathon

I was ready about 14 weeks before the race. I had a few different people who were like, you know, you're good, you've done 12 once, there's an 11 once.

Every week felt like an accomplishment and I have my days I want to run. And I'm hooked, you know? I just finished the half and it was like, that was going to be the longest run ever. I knew I was setting a distance PR for this. Really conservative nine-minute miles, two hours. And then I blew that out of the water.

It's fun, and it's an order of magnitude different than a 5K. At this point, I know that I will do a marathon someday. Maybe not right away. I'm sitting here enjoying this one. But as I think about it, I think that there's something really rewarding about that first big climb. People are intimidated by hills, but I used the right skills and it was just fine.

I think it's about the journey for me. And I think it's a thing that's going to stick. And I don't plan to do a handful of races, just one or two a year.

## What It All Means

It's just incredible that, over the last few months, I've changed. Something was needed. I needed something saying that I solved problems. I'm not saying that I'm a new person or anything. But there's something different that's a part of me that I didn't have before. And that makes me feel good. But I'm not going to over-examine it. I'm going to learn. And I'm going to innovate. And celebrate my accomplishment while I think about what's next.

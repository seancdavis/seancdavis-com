## What The Buzz!

Big news! I launched [my new website](/)!

It was a long time coming, and this site is really just one page today. But it's going to eventually be the new home for my blog posts. I plan to add pages and features to it here and there, and will announce those in these newsletters and [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/seancdavis29).

The stack for this site is:

- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- [Netlify](/blog/wtf-is-netlify/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

When I build out a blog for it, I may end up using a CMS, but have omitted one while it's only a single page site.

I also was able to [add the site to the Eleventy website](https://github.com/11ty/11ty-website/pull/719#issuecomment-678812189), on which it achieved a perfect 💯💯💯💯 performance score, ranking at #85.

In other exciting news, Ample's CTO, Taylor MacDonald (a.k.a. _My Boss_), wrote a [Netlify plugin](https://github.com/netlify/plugins) for replacing strings in built files before uploading them. [Here's the PR](https://github.com/netlify/plugins/pull/130). This is a pretty powerful idea that is part of a larger strategy, on which [he'll be giving a talk](https://jamstackconfvirtual2020.sched.com/event/eMju/migrating-to-netlify-one-page-at-a-time) at the Jamstack conference in October.

Elsewhere in the industry, [Gatsby announced their Recipes Alpha 2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-08-04-Announcing-Gatsby-Recipes-Alpha-2/).

## In My Words

It's been an interesting start to supplementing tutorial articles with screencast videos. It's a long process, but I've enjoyed it so far and look forward to adding more over the coming months. I added a couple last month in an article on [programmatically creating JSON pages with GatsbyJS](/blog/programmatically-create-json-pages-gatsby).

I also added a few foundational articles to the [WTF collection](/topics/wtf):

- [WTF is Hoisting?](/blog/wtf-is-hoisting)
- [WTF is a Closure?](/blog/wtf-is-a-closure)

I enjoyed exploring work I've been doing recently on [building websites faster by creating conventional tooling](/blog/build-jamstack-sites-faster-with-conventional-tooling).

A colleague asked me how to get started writing JavaScript, so I wrote him [a guide](/blog/right-way-to-learn-javascript-2020).

And last, I added a handful of random articles, including one for [Ample](https://www.ample.co/) (the agency I work for):

- [What makes developers happy?](https://www.ample.co/blog/3-things-that-make-developers-happy)
- [Run JavaScript when Variable Exists](/blog/run-javascript-when-variable-exists)
- [Add a Static Directory to an Eleventy Project](/blog/add-static-directory-to-eleventy)
- [How to Fix "Integrity check failed ..." Yarn Error](/blog/fix-yarn-integrity-check-failed)

## Shop Talk

I've begun the process of diving deep into web page performance. While I've started with an Eleventy project, my plan is to eventually expand the expertise I gain to other frameworks with which I have less control over the build output, like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org).

One developer on my team is going to join me on this performance journey, as he has been getting interested in it lately. He really enjoys the [Front End Happy Hour](https://frontendhappyhour.com/) podcast, and share with me [this episode on web performance](https://frontendhappyhour.com/episodes/quick-pour-web-performance/).

## New (to me) Tools

    alt="The Spinneret Issue #4: New (to me) Tools",
    classes="my-8 w-56 mx-auto",
    flatten=true %}

And here are some new tools I discovered last month:

- [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/): This feels like a really powerful idea. To be able to pull in packages from a CDN and not have to have a crazy messy `package.json` file seems very cool. I'm curious to see what comes of this project. The creator talked more about it [on a JAMstack Radio episode](https://overcast.fm/+HI368EK4s).
- [Quokka.js](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode): I've actually known about this for a few years, but haven't shared it here before. It came back up in conversation last month and I thought I'd bring it up, as I use it regularly. (It's a VS Code plugin.)
- [Speedlify](https://github.com/zachleat/speedlify): This is a very cool tool from Zach Leatherman (Eleventy creator) which will record page performance scores.
- [Responsively App](https://responsively.app/)
- [calibreapp/image-actions](https://github.com/calibreapp/image-actions): A Github Action that automatically compresses JPEGs, PNGs and WebPs in pull requests.
- [Monkey Type](https://monkey-type.com/): A stripped down typing test. I played around with it a bit and enjoyed the experience. I did not enjoy my typing speed. 😉

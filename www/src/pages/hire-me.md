I get a lot of requests for work. I'm happy to help, but I'm not always available. If you're interested in working together, look at the process and types of work I do below. If you think we're a good fit, [let's talk](/contact).

## Types of Work

I've been hired for many different types of work. Today I limit this to content creation (writing, teaching, speaking), documentation, and consultation.

### Writing

Writing blog posts is my bread and butter. I've been published on a number of places: [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/author/seancdavis/), [LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/seandavis/), [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/exchange/community/seancdavis), [Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/blog), [Ample](https://www.ample.co/blog-authors/sean-c-davis), [Grouparoo](https://www.grouparoo.com/blog/author/seancdavis).

I can cover a wide range of topics. Today, I'm mostly focused on building modern websites, which can include architecture, development, and design. I'd suggest looking through [the posts](/posts) or [topics](/topics) on this site for an idea of what I've been writing about lately, while noting that I'm always open to new topics.

### Documentation

A big part of my full-time job is writing documentation. I currently write and maintain [Stackbit's documentation](https://docs.stackbit.com/). Generally, I prefer documenting developer tools, but I'm open to other types of documentation.

### Consultation

Much of the freelance work I've done in the last couple years has had a consultation element to it. This is often to support new startups on building their website or product. Or it's been to help clients who are updating their website, moving from an older system to more modern technology.

### Teaching & Speaking

I'm open to teaching workshops and courses, or to giving talks at meetups or conferences. I've done both in the past, and I'm happy to discuss your needs.

## Contracting Process

If your work falls into one of the categories below and you are interested in working together, here's how it typically works:

### Booking Time

Clients (you) book my time in weeks. This typically maxes out at two weeks per month (per client).

### Pricing & Productivity

I charge is $1,500 per week of work.

To give you an idea of productivity, here's the output you can expect:

- **Blog Posts:** Roughly 2k words per week. In other words, this usually means about 2-3 short posts, one longer post. Extra long posts or posts that involve a lot of research or code often span multiple weeks. For example, I wrote an _ultimate guide_ type of post that took me four weeks to write and was about 8.5k words.
- **Documentation:** Much more difficult to estimate, as it depends on the type and complexity of the documentation. There will also likely be a period of learning for the first couple weeks, in which I won't be as productive.
- **Teaching/Speaking:** This varies greatly depending on the scope of what you'd like to accomplish.
- **Consultation:** It often makes more sense to use an hourly contract for this type of work, but that also varies depending on your needs. I'd be [happy to discuss](/contact).

### Payment

Before working together, the first week must be paid in advance. Following that, I invoice monthly. Most clients pay me via their company's ACH system. The service I use also accepts credit cards, checks, and PayPal.

### Contracting

I can provide my own contract or adapt to yours. I'm also happy to work directly with your legal team to make sure we're all on the same page.

My preference with contracts is that they are short and simple. I'm generally happy to give up ownership to the work I do on your behalf (only within the scope of that project).

### Adapting to Your Needs

These are my preferences. But I can be flexible. If you have a different process, I'm happy to [have a chat](/contact) to see if we'd be a good fit.
